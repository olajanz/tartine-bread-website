<h2>How to get started</h2>


<h3>YOU WILL MAKE</h3>
<ul> 2 loaves</ul>

<h3>YOU NEED</h3>
<ul> 2 weeks (or 2 days with active starter)</ul>

<h3>FOR THE STARTER</h3>
<ul>
<li>1000 grams white-bread flour </li>
<li>1000 grams whole-wheat flour</li>
</ul>

<h3>FOR THE BREAD</h3>

<li>200 grams leaven</li>
<li>900 grams white-bread flour</li>
<li>100 grams whole-wheat flour, plus more for dusting</li>
<li>20 grams fine sea salt</li>
<li>100 grams rice flour</li>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<h3>STEP 1</h3>

<p> Make the starter: Combine 1,000 grams white-bread flour with 1,000 grams whole-wheat flour. Put 100 grams of warm water (about 80 degrees) in a small jar or container and add 100 grams of the flour mix. Use your fingers to mix until thoroughly combined and the mixture is the consistency of thick batter. Cover with a towel and let sit at room temperature until mixture begins to bubble and puff, 2 to 3 days.
</p>

<h3>STEP 2</h3>

<p>When starter begins to show signs of activity, begin regular feedings. Keep the starter at room temperature, and at the same time each day discard 80 percent of the starter and feed remaining starter with equal parts warm water and white-wheat flour mix (50 grams of each is fine). When starter begins to rise and fall predictably and takes on a slightly sour smell, it’s ready; this should take about 1 week.(Reserve remaining flour mix for leaven.)</p>
</p> 

<h3>STEP 3</h3>

<p>Make the leaven: The night before baking, discard all but 1 tablespoon of the mature starter. Mix the remaining starter with 200 grams of warm water and stir with your hand to disperse. Add 200 grams of the white-wheat flour mix and combine well. Cover with a towel and let rest at room temperature for 12 hours or until aerated and puffed in appearance. To test for readiness, drop a tablespoon of leaven into a bowl of room-temperature water; if it floats it’s ready to use. If it doesn’t, allow more time to ferment.
